Heavy metal longsleeve made in 1988
Fake nugget wristwatch made in 1988
Dixie cup in the cup holder, shakin', makin' waves

Boom, boom, boom, got Jurassic Park 808's
Ooh, I'm Elvis Presley, 38's on 22's
Rhinestone jacket like Joshua Hedley
Yeah, I got that Honolulu
Flower power, bouquet, medley
'Bout to throw this Chevy in Tom Cruise
And go Trailer Park Hollywood, go Trailer Park Hollywood

Yeah, I got a Styrofoam cooler full of cheap suds
Rock a necklace that I pulled off a sink plug
